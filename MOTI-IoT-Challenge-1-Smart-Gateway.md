#IoT Smart Gateway Challenge

The BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) is looking to enhance the successful sensor and camera systems employed by the ministry. The Internet of Things (IoT) promises a unified method to integrate and centrally manage a broad spectrum of devices within a single “source-of-truth” system to be leveraged across multiple applications, ministries and public innovations.

##The Challenge

MOTI needs to rapidly connect to and manage its devices so that it can monitor, replace and add devices as its business needs change. Build a Proof of Concept (POC) gateway to demonstrate integration and management of devices with the data flowing across traditional or advance communication networks. The goal is to connect with an assortment of best-of-breed, heterogeneous devices through open standards. This challenge is an opportunity for tech firms to discover MOTI’s need and demonstrate innovations that MOTI should be considering when purchasing new sensors, cameras and smart gateways.

Successful POCs will prove connectivity across multiple vendor types.

Our challenge partner will build a gateway that delivers the integration and management of:

1.	A range of smart through constrained devices
2.	An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) device
3.	Fixed location and mobile devices

A smart device houses onboard processing, storage and connectivity capability with adequate power supply. A constrained device offers limited processing, memory, input-output and is often low-powered or battery operated. An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) device is provided by a manufacturer where the proprietary inner workings are unknown (a black box). 

The gateway solution will connect each of these different device types to our open-source prototype IoT platform using the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol.

Innovators who are also able to bring forth next generation connectivity solutions that are both low-power and robust, including next generation cellular, mesh wireless, satellite, etc., which support HD/SD video, seismic, weather, and other sensor types, are most welcome to include those solution options, as well.

Of interest are devices such as, but not limited to: weather devices, accelerometers, speed signs, cameras, seismic sensors, etc.

##Success Criteria

Our goals using the MOTI prototype IoT platform include:

Device Integration which provides a simple, repeatable, standardized connection method for sets of heterogeneous and best-of-breed devices; an accurate, secure and fully-functional connection; a reliable means to remotely verify that the service device is properly connected and working as intended; connectivity for automated safety and control actions; and, demonstrates support for multiple device vendor types. 

Device Management which provides accurate, real-time device status; accommodations for communications latency; remote configuration and updates; remote, real-time control (push instructions); remote establishment and modification of device rules with alert/notification thresholds; and the device history.

Devices of interest include, but are not limited to, weather devices, accelerometers, cameras, seismic sensors and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) devices.

*Examples include:*

* Mobile optical temperature sensors on vehicles measuring road surface temperature and ice formation
* Working with adaptive network systems such as mesh, agile, hub and spoke
* Data aggregation and control for remote locations with limited power and communication bandwidths
* Device management for smart sensors

As part of this challenge, we would involve our challenge partners to assist with designing and standing up our APIs in support of our modular, open-platform approach.
