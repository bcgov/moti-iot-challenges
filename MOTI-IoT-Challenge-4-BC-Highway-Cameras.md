# IoT BC Highway Cameras Challenge

The BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) is seeking a proof-of-concept (POC) to demonstrate innovative management of the B.C. highway cameras via their IoT proof of concept platform so that they can prove the technology concepts and learn from a properly defined technology model.

## The Challenge

MOTI would like a greater understanding of the possibilities for using modern web cameras so that it can make the smartest investment with its camera replacement program. Build a POC that demonstrates innovative use of data from traffic management and BC highway cameras, such as extensions for spatial awareness, integration with other sensors (e.g. weather), video content analysis and real-time alerting systems. This challenge is an opportunity for tech firms to discover MOTI’s needs and demonstrate innovations that MOTI should be considering when purchasing new capabilities for its camera network.

B.C. has a long and successful history of providing road camera access to citizens via the DriveBC website. As MOTI continues towards an intelligent transportation system by implementing an IoT platform, there are great opportunities to not only improve the existing B.C. highway camera services (e.g. more cameras, improved uptimes, better device management), but to extend the capabilities in new and innovative ways - providing spatially-aware capabilities to support integration with other sensors (e.g. weather, Open511, traffic management systems) and adding even more services based on video content analysis. This latter capability transitions a passive camera into a real-time alerting systems for highway users, first responders, intelligent vehicles – and potentially much more.

### Success Criteria

This proof-of-concept will deliver an innovative use of this camera information to demonstrate the technology and highlight new opportunities for further leveraging taxpayer investment in B.C.’s highway camera system.

Integrate with our MOTI open source IoT platform to:

* Build a camera management capability for B.C. highway cameras on top of our IoT proof-of-concept platform leveraging existing or new cameras.

* Make use of spatially-aware capabilities to support integration of cameras with other sensors.

* Demonstrate the capability to adjust the configuration of the sensors based on local video analysis.

* Demonstrate the technical capability to automatically detect and determine events through video content analysis to enhance the data coming back from the device, for example (but not limited to):

  * Provide “volume of traffic” metrics from the camera for use in traffic management solutions – real-time and trends.

  * Detect accidents, stalled vehicles or debris identified in the camera stream

* For example, curve warnings based on curve cornering analysis

  * Identify the ongoing presence of first responders at the location

  * Identify sections of the feed that might warrant further review – abnormal events vs. routine traffic

  * Provide a data stream suitable for distribution to other stakeholders – traffic volume/delays, accident notifications, etc.

Example scenarios include:

* Vehicle detection and counting

* Track disruptive, abnormal stoppage events, such as a collision or avalanche

* Video traffic analysis for event detection, such as increasing volume, traffic flow changes, vehicle swerving, etc.

* Stationary object detection on the roadway, such as visually detecting vehicle pull-overs, truckload debris, windblown materials or roadkill interfering with traffic or posing a hazard

Possible capabilities demonstrated in the solution include, but are not limited to:

* Camera Registry: View operational status and apply controls

* Dynamic Masking: Blocking part of a video signal (for privacy)

* Object Detection: Detect and differentiate a car, motorcycle or a large truck, tractor-trailer

* Video Tracking: Determine the location of vehicles or objects in reference to an external reference grid

* Tamper Detection: Determine whether a camera or output signal is tampered with

As part of this challenge, we would involve our challenge partners to assist with designing and standing up our APIs in support of our modular, open-platform approach.
