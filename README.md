# MOTI / BCIC IoT Challenges

On March 13, 2017 the BC Innovation Council (BCIC) hosted the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) and the BC Tech community at an [IoT Discovery Day](http://bcic.ca/events/iot-discovery-day/). At that event, BCIC presented a series of challenges to the BC Tech Community to collaborate with MOTI in creating multi-party, multi-platform and multi-device government IoT capabilities.

This repository provides parties interested in participating in BCIC's IoT Challenges with information on MOTI, BCIC, the MOTI IoT Proof-of-Concept (PoC) platform and a map to background information about the challenge.

Start here to learn about the business and technical components of the IoT Challenges.

##Who is MOTI?

The [BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure](http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/) (MOTI) plans transportation networks, provides transportation services and infrastructure, develops and implements transportation policies, and administers many related acts and regulations, as well as, federal-provincial funding programs, including the Building Canada Fund.

##Who is BCIC?

[BC Innovation Council](http://bcic.ca/) (BCIC) encourages the development and application of advanced or innovative technologies to meet the needs of industry in BC. We accelerate technology commercialization by supporting startups and developing entrepreneurs.

##IoT Challenge

To enhance our ability to deliver a modern IoT capability, MOTI is participating in the BC Tech Summit Challenge. Based on our experiences in creating the IoT Prototype, we developed a list of key challenges that we are putting out to the BC Tech sector, with the added goal of demonstrating how the BC government can work with the tech industry to develop new technologies through open source development.

MOTI, in partnership with the BC Innovation Council (BCIC), will fund up to five projects aimed at tackling our IoT Challenges. BC Tech organizations will be selected to go further with their ideas, with seed funding of $10,000 (each) to drive innovation. A sixth (unfunded) challenge, is an opportunity for BCâ€™s IoT leaders to provide guidance on our strategic direction.

Details of the challenges can be found here:

* MOTI IoT [Challenge 2: Event Stream Processing](./MOTI-IoT-Challenge-2-Event-Stream-Processing.md)
* MOTI IoT [Challenge 3: Analytics](./MOTI-IoT-Challenge-3-Analytics.md)
* MOTI IoT [Challenge 4: BC Highway Cameras](./MOTI-IoT-Challenge-4-BC-Highway-Cameras.md)
* MOTI IoT [Challenge 5: Open Innovation](./MOTI-IoT-Challenge-5-Open-Innovation.md)
* Your Ideas: [IoT Strategic Direction](./MOTI-IoT-Your-Ideas-IoT-Strategic-Direction.md)

###Challenge Evaluation Criteria

Successful challenges will be evaluated based upon:

* how innovative the solution is;
* how easily the proof-of-concept can be deployed into a production environment;
* how easy the solution is to update and maintain in the long term;
* how closely it leverages our proof-of-concept IoT platform to align with our desired use of open, widely-adopted (mature) standards that integrate with our IoT stack; 
* and, how useful the solution is to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, BC citizens and/or the traveling public.

###MOTI IoT Challenge Technical Information

The following is the layout of the information MOTI has assembled as part of this PoC about IoT and the challenges we have put together around IoT for interested collaborators. 

* [MOTI's IoT Initiative](./MOTI-IoT-Initiative.md)
* [MOTI's IoT Proof-of-Concept Approach and Architectural Overview](https://github.com/bcgov/moti-iot-poc)
* MOTI IoT PoC Platform: The [Eclipse Kapua Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.kapua)
* [MOTI's Eclipse Kapua repository](https://github.com/bcgov/kapua)
* MOTI IoT PoC Gateway: The [Eclipse Kura Project](http://www.eclipse.org/kura/)
* The [MOTI IoT PoC github repository](https://github.com/bcgov/moti-iot-poc) contains the code developed based on Eclipse Kapua, Karu and other Open Source tools for the demo presented at the BC Tech Summit 2017.

The MOTI IoT PoC is intended to be used as the basis for the BCIC/MOTI IoT Challenge collaborations.
