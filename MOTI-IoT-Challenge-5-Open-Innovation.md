#IoT Open Innovation Challenge

The BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) is seeking innovative proof-of-concepts to demonstrate an ingenious use of our prototype IoT platform so that we can showcase the platform’s broad capability, prove the technology concepts and learn from a properly defined solution.

##The Challenge

This IoT Open Innovation Challenge provides an opportunity for BC tech firms to demonstrate how their innovations can help the ministry and BC citizens realize the benefits of IoT technologies. This challenge is an opportunity for tech firms to build a proof of concept that showcases opportunities for IoT innovation and shapes our thinking on modernizing MOTI’s IoT system.

Show how MOTI can deliver significant benefits from IoT by unlocking sensor data to enhance existing traffic management, safety and road conditions programs. Show how a transportation-based IoT ecosystem can transform the way people live, work, and travel as part of the digital world.

MOTI is offering clever innovators the opportunity to present a proof-of-concept for a solution that could create extensive value to our citizens and commuters on BC highways by leveraging our IoT platform. The challenge partner will be given access to the prototype IoT platform and MOTI data to introduce a new, innovative, disruptive concept that will clearly demonstrate an innovation in thinking and offer appealing value to citizens and business in the context of transportation.

###Success Criteria

Our goal is to support the development of innovative concepts which demonstrate value leveraging our extensive MOTI cameras, sensors and data through our prototype IoT platform.

Additionally, as part of this challenge, we involve our challenge partners to assist with designing and standing up our APIs in support of our open-platform, modular approach.

Examples of innovations leveraging MOTI data and the IoT platform:

* Enable smart transportation solutions using MOTI real-time data

* Ways to disseminate MOTI weather data through open standards

* Next generation of applications to manage smart sensors

* Ways to connect MOTI data with the coming wave of autonomous vehicle data
